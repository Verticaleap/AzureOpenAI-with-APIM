# Manage Azure OpenAI using APIM

## Overview

One-button deploy APIM, Keyvault, and Log Ananlytics. Auto-configure APIM to work with your Azure OpenAI endpoint. 

Using Azure's APIM orchestration provides a organizations with a powerful way to scale and manage their Azure OpenAI service without deploying Azure OpenAI endpoints everywhere. Administrators can issue subscription keys via APIM for accessing a single Azure OpenAI service instead of having teams share Azure OpenAI keys. APIM delivers usage metrics along with API monitoring to improve business intelligence. APIM policies control access, throttling, and a mechanism for chargeback cost models.

## Solutions

There are four solutions developed to meet the needs of the organization from a sandbox to model a production environment.

### Azure Commercial API Management to Azure OpenAI

Use API management deployed to the Azure Commercial cloud using public IP addresses for accessing APIM and for APIM to access the Azure OpenAI API. Access to the services is secured using keys and Defender for Cloud. 

![Azure Commercial API Management to Azure OpenAI](./images/architecture-commercial_apim-to-aoai.png)

#### Deploy

**! NOTE !** - It can take up to 45 minutes for all services to deploy as API Management has many underlying Azure resources deployed running the service.

### Azure Commercial API Management to Azure OpenAI with private endpoints

Use API management deployed to the Azure Commercial cloud using private IP addresses for accessing APIM and for APIM to access the Azure OpenAI API. Access to the services is secured using private network connectivity, keys and Defender for Cloud. Access to the private network is controlled by customer infrastructure and supports internal routing via Express Route or site-2-site VPN for broader enterprise network access like on-premises data centers or site-based users.

### Azure Government API Management to Azure OpenAI

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Update to use only use MAG

Use API management deployed to the Azure Government cloud using public IP addresses for accessing APIM and for APIM to access the Azure Commercial-based Azure OpenAI API. Access to the services is secured using keys and Defender for Cloud. 

Network routing from the APIM to the Azure OpenAI address uses Microsoft's backbone, eliminating public routing.

## Tying it All together

Read through the following steps to setup interacting with APIM and how to use consoles or .net to programatically interact with Azure OpenAI via APIM.

### Get your Azure OpenAI Model Name

To determine if you have one or more models deployed, visit the AI Studio. Here you can determine if you need to create a model or use an existing model. You will use the model name when quering the Azure OpenAI API via your APIM.

![Get your Azure OpenAI Model Name](./images/get-your-aoai-model-name.png)

1. Navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource in Azure
2. Select **Model deployments**
3. Select **Manage Deployments**

4. Review your models and copy the **Deployment name** of the model you want to use

### Get your APIM Subscription Key

The subscription key for APIM is collected at the Subscription section of the APIM resource, regardless if you are in Azure Commercial or Government.

You can use this key for testing or as an example on how to create subscriptions to provide access to you Azure OpenAI service. Instead of sharing your Azure OpenAI Key, you create subscriptions in APIM and share this key, then you can analyze and monitor usage, provide guardrails for usage, and manage access.

![Get your APIM Subscription Key](./images/get-your-apim-sub-key.png)

1. Navigate to your new APIM
2. Select **Subscriptions** from the menu
3. Select **...**
4. Select **Show/Hide keys**
5. Select **copy icon**

### Get your APIM Azure OpenAI URL

The URL for APIM is collected at the Overview section of the APIM resource, regardless if you are in Azure Commercial or Government.

![Get your APIM Azure OpenAI URL](./images/get-your-apim-url.png)

### Query Examples

Using your Azure OpenAI model, API version, APIM URL, and APIM subscription key you can now execute Azure OpenAI queries against your APIM URL instead of your Azure OpenAI URL. This means you can create new subscription keys for anyone or any team who needs access to Azure OpenAI instead of deploying new Azure OpenAI services.

```

### Get Public IP Address of my Azure OpenAI service

When deploying to Azure Government with Private endpoints, the deployment process requires the public IP address of the Azure OpenAI service. Use ping or nslookup with fqdn of your Azure OpenAI url to determine it's public IP address.

- example: 
  - url is https://aoai.openai.azure.com
  - fqdn is aoai.openai.azure.com

Then use nslookup in PowerShell terminal, or Linux console, along with the fqdn to find out the public IP address of your Azure OpenAI service.

## SAS Key Management

### Secure API SAS Key

There are two methods of securely storing the SAS key

#### Secure SAS Keys using APIM encrypted Name Value
